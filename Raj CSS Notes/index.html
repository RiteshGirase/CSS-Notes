        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>My name is Ritesh Girase</p>
    </div>
    <p>I am very much helpful to all which in return also gives me more love and support</p>

    <p id="para">Know the selectors in css like we can style the css with the help of the id and classes</p><br>

    <div>
        <h3>Lets see the child selector for details visit css code mention over their</h3>
    </div>
    <div id="sel">
        <h2>Selctors details</h2><br>
        <p>Hii i am a Ritesh. Now go to css file code to see how chils selector is used</p>
        <p>In the same way we are having the descendant selector which means if we are writing like div p its show
            select p from div no matter where it is it should be inside the div</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Selector, fonts(text), cascade algorithm,size, shadow and navbar details</h2><br>
        <p> Hii myself ritesh now see the universal selector which metion as * and then also see the pusedo selectors
            like :hover, :link, :active etc and then know the margin, padding concept and main thing margin collaspe
            means in case if two margin intersect then atomatically the highest the margin will be get selected.</p>

        <p id="para1">After this see the property of fonts,text the most and colors how we have can use different colors
            in the website like darj, hex, rgb, rgba,hsl etc also see the various property of the text like transfom,
            decoration etc and in fonts family, style etc</p>

        <p class="harryclass rohan-class"> The cascade is the algorithm for solving conflicts where multiple CSS rules
            apply to an HTML element. It's the reason that the text of the button styled with the above CSS will be
            purple. Position and order of appearance: the order in which your CSS rules appear
            Specificity: an algorithm that determines which CSS selector has the strongest match
            Origin: the order in which CSS appears and where it comes from, whether that is a browser style, CSS from a
            browser extension, or your authored CSS
            Importance: some CSS rules are weighted more heavily than others, especially with the !important rule type
            Lets look into all these one by one . Universal Selector: 0
            Element selectors and pseudo-elements: 1
            Class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes: 10
            ID selectors: 100
            Inline styles: 1000</p>

        <p id="para4">Lets see the units of size now where we are having px, vw (viewportwidth) which indicates the
            width according to the view we are having like desktop and adjusting the widht and same height as a vh
            (viewportheight), and then we are having em ( em=18 px and the we can give further the units as 2em, 3em etc
            ) and then again we are having the rem which means according to root element unit like if root having 20px
            then we can set 3rem, 4rem etc and then came percent details like 50%, 60% which sets according to the
            parent item etc</p>

        <p> After this i had used the shadow property you can see in the first div my name is wala and the property we
            can use it is ( box-shadow: h-offset v-offset blur spread color inset ) and then if we want then can also
            used the text shadow property in order make the text shadow using method as ( text-shadow: h-offset v-offset
            blur color; ) and then also see the concept outlines which makes outlines over the content and main thing we
            cannot change the outline width it is fixed but can use to make content in a box.</p>

        <p>After this we have to see the navbar details where we are getting the various options about how we can make
            the list in a proper format by using it property like its style typoe and all for ex ( disc: (default) -
            Filled circle marker
            circle: hollow circle marker
            square: a filled square marker
            None: No marker (remove bullets) for unordered list ) and (decimal: (default) - Decimal numbers (1, 2, 3,
            etc.)
            decimal-leading-zero: Decimal numbers with leading zeros (01, 02, 03, etc.)
            lower-roman: lowercase Roman numbers (i, ii, iii,...)
            upper-roman: uppercase Roman numbers (I, II, III,...)
            lower-alpha: lowercase alphabetical letters (a, b, c, etc.)
            upper-alpha: uppercase alphabetical letters (A, B, C, etc.) for ordered list) also we can set url image in a
            style type etc.</p>
        <div>
            <nav>
                <ul>
                    <li>Home</li>
                    <li>About</li>

    </div>
    <div class="jaanu">
        <h2>Position details</h2><br>
        Here we have to read the details of the position in the css like (1) Relative : It meand that we can change the
        position of the box anywhere by our need as by defaul it is static menas no change, (2) Absolute : means we have
        to give parent position and accoding to it we change the postion of the box, (3) Fixed : It means it got fixed
        in the website it doent change it position, (4) Sticky ; upto it limit it get scroll and get then get stick in
        the upper side etc.--------Exception if we mention property like ransform, filter and perspective in the parent
        box or element then another box will change the position thorugh the parent only doesmt matter we mention the
        position in the parent or not.
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Variables details</h2><br>Again here the conceptcame of variables its easy if we have to use the samw thing
        again and again we can make use of variables like ( :root{ define variables } and when we have to use it we can
        use as a var(--variables name)).
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Media Query</h2>Media query is used whn we have to change something in a website when it is used or viewed
        in the other devices for examplese check the quwey in css and do work.
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Float and clear property</h2>If we use the float in the css means that we can make the flow the particular
        image or things in a particular direction if left then allow right space for other content and clear is used to
        make the content propritize that anything should not be seen in a particular direction mention in clear.

    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Flex Property Details</h2><br>
        When we give display as a flex first of all, all items get arrange in row direction and other property we are
        having is justify content if make center then according to roe get center and of align items center is done
        means the items get arrange in centr in whole screen or in a box then we can use flex wrap, then we can give gap
        between items also as a row and colunm gaps, it we have more then 2 lines boxes having display flex and want to
        make center then we have to use the align content method as center and we can also change the position of align
        items as a flex start and flex end, this all property is apply in main div inside which boxes are their in that
        also we can use the flex flow property.

        <h3>Flex property for items</h3><br>
        We can use the property like flex-grow to increase the box size and then also we can use the flex-shrink
        property which means whenever screen will shrink prticular box will shrink upto its shrink limlit and if we want
        to change the single box position we can use the align self property to make center. And now the most important
        thing is we can give the order to the box like ( .order-1{ order:1;}in this way, after forming this we can
        assign particular class to the elemnt and then they will get arrange according to the order mention in the order
        css property.)

        <h2>Transform details</h2><br>
        This property allows the content to be restructured in ways like translate, rotate, scale or skew, etc.As it is
        2D, therefore the content is transformed into x and y dimensions. For more info visit code with harry.com
        website explain nicely over their.

    <div>
        <h2>Transition details</h2><br>
        <p>Transitions control the ease of transformation from one style to another when we hover over that element.
            Basically, you can control the time take for any transformation to occur. Here we have to see the 4 main
            properties known as transition-property, duration, -timing function, -delay etc if want we can combine this
            as transition: all 3s ease-in-out 1s.</p>

    <div>
        <h2>Animation details</h2><br>
        <p>CSS Animations help to animate elements from one frame to another. Controlling various CSS properties helps
            in changing the animation style and time without having the need to use JavaScript for the same.The most
            basic way to do so is by using “from” and “to”.</p>

            Property inspect of parent property etc by giving postion like top-right, bottom-left etc we can show the
